# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

# Topic: Ecommerce Customer BehaviorAnalysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset to understand data patterns, clean inconsistencies, handle missing values, and generate meaningful insights using visualizations.

The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow including:

- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values
- Removing Outliers
- Feature Transformation
- Statistical Summary
- Data Visualization

The final output is exported as an HTML file (`EDA_Project.html`).
